# High Performance Computing Projects

This repository contains **7 projects** focused on parallelizing intensive computational tasks using **C/C++**, **Python**, and **MATLAB**. 
The aim is to showcase efficient use of **C/C++**, HPC libraries and tools (MPI, OpenMP, PETSc, etc.) for problems including graph bisection, matrix operations, and more.
